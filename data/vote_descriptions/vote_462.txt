That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and substituting the following: 
“the House reject the government's budget statement because it fails middle class Canadians, women, and business operators by:(a) raising taxes on over 90% of Canadian middle-class families;(b)  announcing new tax hikes on local businesses;(c)    borrowing an additional $18 billion; (d) jeopardizing our future generations by choosing not to balance the budget by 2019; and(e) spending so much to achieve so little.”
