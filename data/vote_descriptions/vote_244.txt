That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and substituting the following: 
“the House not approve the budgetary policy of the government as it:(a)   includes a further deficit of at least $29 billion;(b)  contains no plan to return the books to balance;(c)    nickel-and-dimes Canadian taxpayers to death by hiking taxes on public transit users, Uber and ride-sharing, beer and wine, donated medicines, childcare, and small business owners; and(d)  demonstrates that the government’s economic plan has failed to create the jobs it promised.”
