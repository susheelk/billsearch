That, in the opinion of the House, the government committed a gross error in judgement when it operationalized the previous Conservative government’s Phoenix pay system over the clear objections of both the affected unions and departmental staff, and that the House call on the government to: 
(a) pay all employees correctly and on time, every time, for the work they do;
(b) exempt those who have been overpaid by Phoenix from having to pay back the ‘gross’ amount, despite actually receiving a substantially lower ‘net’ amount;
(c) compensate those in the public service who have experienced damages from Phoenix, both financial and otherwise; and
(d) publicly apologize to all of those who have endured hardship as a result of the government's error
