That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and substituting the following:“the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-24, An Act to amend the Salaries Act and to make a consequential amendment to the Financial Administration Act, since the Bill:  (a) lacks transparency by failing to disclose the government’s plans with respect to the creation of additional Ministers to be appointed in the future and changes in the financial status of others; and (b) enshrines in law the government’s decision to eliminate regional Ministers responsible for regional economic development agencies.”
