That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and substituting the following:“the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-26, An Act to amend the Canada Pension Plan, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board Act and the Income Tax Act, because it: (a) will take more money from hardworking Canadians; (b) will put thousands of jobs at risk; and (c) will do nothing to help seniors in need.”
