That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That” and substituting the following: “the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-74, An Act to implement certain provisions of the budget tabled in Parliament on February 27, 2018 and other measures, since the Bill: (a) fails to address the cost of the government’s carbon tax to the average Canadian family; (b) neglects to implement, or to even mention, the government’s promise of a balanced budget; and (c) will continue on the path of adding debt at twice the rate foreshadowed by the Minister of Finance.”
