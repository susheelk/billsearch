That, in the opinion of the House:
(a)      public infrastructure should serve the interests of Canadians, not work to make private investors rich;
(b)      during the election, the Liberals did not reveal to voters their plans to privatize investment in public infrastructure;
(c)       infrastructure built by private investors will cost more than public infrastructure;
(d)      it is a conflict of interest to allow private corporations, who will be the largest beneficiaries of the Canada Infrastructure Bank, to participate in the planning and development of the Bank;
(e)      the Bank will leave taxpayers with an unacceptable burden of fees, tolls, and privatization that will only make private investors wealthy, to the detriment of the public interest; and
(f)       the clauses concerning the Canada Infrastructure Bankâ€™s creation should be removed from Bill C-44, Budget Implementation Act, 2017, No. 1, so they can be studied as a stand-alone bill
