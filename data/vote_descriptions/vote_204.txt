That the motion be amended by deleting all the words after the word “That”, and substituting the following:“the House decline to give second reading to Bill C-23, An Act respecting the preclearance of persons and goods in Canada and the United States, because it: (a)	neglects to take into account the climate of uncertainty at the border following the discriminatory policies and executive orders of the Trump Administration; (b)	does not address Canadians’ concerns about being interrogated, detained, and turned back at the border based on race, religion, travel history or birthplace as a result of policies that may contravene the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms; (c)	does nothing to ensure that Canadians’ right to privacy will be protected during searches of their online presence and electronic devices; and (d)	violates Canadian sovereignty by increasing the powers of American preclearance officers on Canadian soil with respect to the carrying of firearms and by not properly defining a criminal liability framework.”
